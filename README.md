## Description
I enjoyed learning Mysql during class, however I had a lot of external factors stopping me from being able to work on this topic, so I have taken advantage of the christmas break to make this work.
Challenges:
I had a tough time learning nodejs and the commandline, I don't feel I was quite understanding at the time, and that knowledge disappeared from me with lack of use during the bootcamp and externally not being currently relevant - something I feel I could pick up comfortably if I used on a regular basis.
A big challenge was my second attempt at pushing my code. I somehow managed to delete all my files and wasn't able to push to GitHub, causing me to create 2-3 new repositories to try and find a quick fix. I have got this working, however as all coding was completed in prior repository that has since disappeared, it'll only have 3-4 pushes to github.
I had trouble understanding the file structure, as well as being unsure what avenue to take in processing.
